## About Me
University of Pretoria student currently studying my 3rd year in BSC Computer Science. I have been improving my coding ability over the years through the introduction of multiple different languages and projects, including the development and use of front-end, back-end, databases, C++, Java, and a few others.
My current skills include proficient knowledge of C++ and Java having spent the last 3 years working with them to develop a wide range of different projects. I have also developed knowledge in front-end and back-end website development working with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Php. I am currently gaining familiarity with Ionic and Angular coding improving my skills the more I develop.

## About Me
Third year BSc Computer Science student. I enjoy programming because it’s just one giant puzzle. I primarily do back-end because I can’t find any documentation on how to be creative.
Skills:
Strongly typed languages such as C++, Java. To a lesser extent, but still proficient: Javascript (Node.js), TypeScript (NestJS). The reason I prefer strongly typed languages is because the error messages they trigger in my IDE are nice and colourful, unlike the monochromatic error messages in my Node console.

## About Me
“Jack of all traits and-unfortunately- master of none.” YET, as I am still a hardworking student at the university of Pretoria and in my final year of BSc Computer Science….hopefully.
My goal in this degree was not to become a genius in a single field but to expose myself to plenty until I find that true soulmate to master. Just won a mild hacking competition. Next on the list is AI. As if I had a choice.

Current Skills
My valuable skill is fast and efficient learning. Despite starting my degree with limited experience in basic tools like Microsoft text editor and PC games, I quickly adapted and mastered new technologies by effectively searching for documentation and resources. I am confident in my ability to learn and excel in any new software, programming language, or operating system.

My expertise is in implementing algorithms, working with formulas, manipulating numbers, and simplifying complex concepts. I excel in data analysis and problem-solving with analytical and logical thinking.

I am known for working intensely on projects, often sacrificing sleep to complete tasks quickly and review them with a fresh perspective before the deadline.

In summary, my strengths include rapid learning, efficient work, and timely delivery of high-quality results. I actively seek new challenges to expand my skills and contribute effectively to any project or team I am part of.

## About Me
I am a passionate 3rd year BSc Computer Science student currently studying at the University of Pretoria. I am a highly resourceful person who does not quit when problems occur. Instead I research the problem and try to understand how and why problems occur instead of just trying to solve them. My passions lie in back-end development, databases their management as well as project management. I have many years of programming experience from both University projects as well as personal projects that include back-end and database experience. Project management is a passion of mine as I enjoy seeing the product being created excel to its fullest extent. I believe that by having a leader who can push the team to their full potential and one that supports them in their roles and responsibilities a team can complete their tasks at an increased rate
